# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Firebase setup

Install firebase
create signin component
import in app.js file
add link to into navigation component for sign in link
create firebase utils file
generate firebase configuration code from firebase
import libraries from firebase auth
create provider from googleauthprovider
setcustomparameter so that user has to select an account
create auth instance from getAuth
export signinwithpopup and pass auth and provider in it
goto google console->authentication tab->signin method->google->Enable->give project support email->save
signin component-> import signInWithGooglePopup
create button for google login popup to get the access token
whenever user get authenticates we also create a record of them inside of firestore
firebase - create database->start in production mode->next->choose location
firebase rules->allow read,write switch false to true
import libraries from firestore
create db instance from getFireStore();
we want some fn that will take the data or getting from the authentication service and store that inside of firestore
we need to see if there is an existing document reference
